          I'm an entry-level software engineer with a passion for learning and
          solving problems. Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from automating data
          processes with Python and Azure SQL to working on full stack
          application by building APIs with C# .NET and developing front-end
          with React. Right now, I'm developing "Nexus," a mental health support
          app.

          Outside of coding, I love lifting weights and trying out new foods.
          I'm always striving to grow, both mentally and physically!
